# MPI_matrix_Multiplication
## The following is the rubric for a homework in Concurrent Scientific Programming course. We are given 2 weeks to implement Cannonâ€™s Algorithm using MPI. I hope this illustrate my experience in MPI.

Implement Cannon's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm on your own using MPI. Your implementation should be able to handle a matrix size of 1000000x1000000 on 100 nodes.
Each node should only execute serial code, no threading. Your code should be well organized such that each phase is broken up into well written subroutines.
Default matrix size for code performance evaluation will be provided at a later time.
Your homework submission should be a zip file containing the following file structure and names:
- hw5_<userid>.pdf // your writeup
- task1 // A folder containing your solution to hw1 task 1
- hw5_<userid>.cpp
- hw5_<userid>.pbs
Please do not include any other files in your submission.
Evaluation and Expectations:
Your submission will be evaluated on two categories: Code Performance and Documentation.
For Code Performance, your libraries will be evaluated for both function and speed. The Rank of the speed will determine the score earned in the code performance portion of the grade.
For Documentation, your write-up will be evaluated for how well you describe your effort and present your results. It will also be evaluated for technical accuracy. Use the "How to Write Technical Papers" as a guide. You do not need to use all sections of that document.
See the Homework Generic Rubric for additional guidance on how your assignment submission will be evaluated.
Reminder, no credit will be earned for submissions that do not have your name in the documents (Write-up AND source code).
